The assignment of this report conveyed critizing and accessing system-level Internet of Things components in scientififc literature. 
Because the assigned paper did not include anything IoT related, we will present our own idea.
In this section we will provide a short introduction to the Internet of Things and its key features, present our idea and focus on the practicality and entrpreneurial aspect of the idea. 

The Internet of Things refers to uniquely identitfiable objects, or things, and their virtual representations in an Internet-like structure. [ADD REF]. 
The intelligent application is the key feature here. 
Important aspects to be taken into consideration when designing such a system are security, privacy and scalability. 

The anatomy of Internet of Things is initiated by a certain event, that is detected and logged by devices that include self-properties [ADD REF]. 
This data is then uploaded by a ubiquitous and interoperable network. 
The unique feature of the internet of things is that this system is smart and can generate knowledge and by analyzing this data and understands the system. 
Certain events are then triggered and reported as response. 
The intelligence of these systems lie in the adapting mechanisms that analyse and understand the environment in order to deal with the complex dynamics of a real-world environment.
