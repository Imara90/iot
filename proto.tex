The major goal of this report is to be able to develop a real-world application. In order to do this,
all real-world implications need to be taken into consideration. Scenario's were developed to develop a charging protocol 
that accounts for all possible states. For these scenario's a user wearing a tranceiver wristband is considered. Other 
viewpoints for a scenario are a user wearing a receiving wristband or the transmitting bar. However, these viewpoints 
are considerably easier to address and will implements parts of the protocol designed for a tranceiving system.
