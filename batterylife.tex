The battery that we are using has a capacity of 50 mAh, which means if a current $I_B$ of 50 mA  is continuously drawn from the battery, it can last for one hour. To determine the total battery life for our circuit we need to consider the total power consumed $P_c$, for our case $P_c = i_L \times V_l $ from which we can calculate the total life of a fully charged battery.

\begin{center}
 $Total Battery Life = \frac{Battery Capacity}{Power Consumed}$
                    $= \frac{I_B \times V_l \times 1 hour}{i_L \times V_l}$
                    $= \frac{50mA \times 3V \times 1 hour}{20mA \times 3V}$
                    $= 2.5 hours$
