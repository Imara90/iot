The Figure %~\ref{fig:rec_design} 
shows a low level schematic of the receiver and charging circuit which will be the main focus of our project. The induction current $i_r$ induced by the transmitter through magnetic coupling will be the main source of charging current. The current $i_c$ charges the super capacitor, $i_b$ charges the battery and $i_L$ is consumed by the load including resistor $R_L$ and a light source. During the charge cycle $i_r = i_c + i_b +i_L$ . Now in analysis lets first consider the efficiency ${\eta}$ of the circuit.
If $P_{o}$ is the power consumed by the receiver and $P_{i}$ is the power provided by the transmitter, ignoring small power drops across $D_r$ and $C_r$  then:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:effb}
 {\eta} = \frac{P_o}{P_i}
\end{equation}
where $P_o = V_{reg} \times i_r $ and $P_i = V_i \times i_s $
